> Let's make *everything* secure.

With the advent of free SSL and Heroku finally offering free SSL endpoints, it's about time we made it ridiculously easy to get an SSL cert for any Heroku application and keep it up to date.

We wrote a blog post about it [here](https://substrakt.com/heroku-ssl-me-weve-come-a-long-way/)

**This is alpha software. It may work, or it may not. We use it in production at [Substrakt](https://substrakt.com) but your milage may vary until 1.0.**

## What it does
1. Generates a private key.
1. Validates domain ownership using DNS verification for a set of domains including the root. **(Only works with CloudFlare currently!)**
1. Generates a CSR.
1. Generates a LetsEncrypt certificate.
1. Enables the http-sni feature on a specified Heroku application.
1. Adds or updates the certificate with the newly generated one.

## How it works
1. User or robot makes an API request to this application.
1. Magic happens.
1. Site is secure.

## Limitations
As we're currently in alpha, there are some severe limitations.

1. Heroku apps must be in the common runtime. `http-sni` is not supported in private spaces, yet. This shouldn't be a problem for 99% of applications.
1. DNS must be managed by CloudFlare.
1. Renewals do not happen automatically. (Not sure if this is in the scope of this application or whether or not the application itself should handle renewals?)
1. We're using an unreleased Heroku API endpoint and `http-sni` is beta. If it changes or is removed, this application will simply cease to work.
1. It doesn't currently add the CNAME records to CloudFlare once the SSL certificate has been generated. (Possibly out of scope?)
1. It's a bit slow (around 1min per validated subdomain) due to the nature of DNS resolution. Not sure how to resolve this yet.
1. It does not force the secured application to only accept requests via SSL. This is because we use a variety of frameworks so we must remain framework agnostic.

## Installation

You can install letsencrypt-heroku either directly on to Heroku *(recommended)* or download the code and deploy it yourself anywhere you can run a Rack app.

First off, you'll need a Heroku auth token.

1. `heroku plugins:install heroku-cli-oauth`
1. `heroku authorizations:create -d "letsencrypt-heroku"`
1. Save the token from this. We'll use it later.

### Installation on Heroku

1. Deploy automatically to Heroku using this button: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/substrakt/letsencrypt-heroku/tree/master)
1. Input all the required parameters as asked for by the Heroku setup wizard. This includes the heroku token from above.
1. This will set up the application and all dependencies automatically including a free instance of Heroku Redis. (Redis is used to process background jobs amongst other things.)
1. On the command line run `heroku config:get AUTH_TOKEN`. The response is the secret token. **Every request made to the API must have the query parameter `auth_token=TOKEN` added to it. You'll receive a 403 error if you forget to do this.**

### Installation elsewhere
You can deploy this application anywhere you can run a Rack app. (Azure, Heroku, AWS, local, etc.)

1. Download the repo `git clone https://github.com/substrakt/letsencrypt-heroku.git`
1. Install Redis. (`brew install redis`)
1. Install foreman (`gem install foreman`)
1. Copy `.envsample` to `.env` using `cp .envsample .env`. The `.env` file is read when the application starts and should contain all of the required environment variables. One of these is the token generated earlier for Heroku. **DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO SOURCE CONTROL**
1. Run the application locally using `foreman start`.
1. Deploy however you want to!

## Usage
1. Hit the following endpoint:

```
GET certificate_generation/new/{domain_name}?subdomains={subdomains}&debug={0/1}&app_name={heroku_app_name}&auth_token={auth_token}
```

Parameters:

* `domain_name` is the domain name without subdomains. (e.g. `google.com` == Good. `www.google.com` == Bad.)
* `subdomains` is a comma delimited list of subdomains to cover. Usually this is just `www`, but could also be anything else such as `www,dishwasher,git,purple`.
* `debug` is `1` or `0` depending if this is a test or not. When debug is on, non-valid certificates are generated.
* `heroku_app_name` is the name of the application on Heroku.
* `auth_token` is the value of `ENV['AUTH_TOKEN']`.

This will start the process in the background and output something like this:

```
{
  status_path: "http://localhost:5000/certificate_generation/3911dd66aade4cfdf9dd1d0e1cebde87"
}
```

That API URL will give you updates as to the certificate generation process. You should poll this to check how it's going. Redis is used as a store for status updates as well as the backend for Resque.

The output looks something like this:

```
{
  token: "3911dd66aade4cfdf9dd1d0e1cebde87",
  status: "success",
  error: null,
  domain: "substrakt.com",
  subdomains: [
    "www",
    "www3"
  ],
  message: "Done"
}
```



**That's it.**
